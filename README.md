# Internationalization in DITA
Just like in any other localization scenario, managing terminology in DITA can be a tough nut to crack. We've opened up a repository including the following resources for managing multilingual terminology in DITA:

- Dedicated DITA topic containing multilingual term entries
- XSLT file to convert the DITA topic to TBX
- Sample TBX conversion
- XCS file

The DITA topic supports metadata fields such as "definition" or "domain" on different levels. The XSLT generates a TBX format that is fully compatible with many TMS (memoQ, Phrase, XTM).

This is a first attempt to standardize and streamline terminology management between authoring and localization teams, which ensures an additional layer of internationalization on top of the DITA standard.
