# Internationalization in DITA
Multilingual terminology in DITA incl. conversion to TBX with XSLT

This repository includes the following resources for managing multilingual terminology in DITA:
- Dedicated DITA topic containing multilingual term entries
- XSLT file to convert the DITA topic to TBX
- Sample TBX conversion
- XCS file

The DITA topic supports metadata fields such as "definition" or "domain" on different levels. The XSLT generates a TBX format that is fully compatible with many TMS (memoQ/QTerm, Memsource, XTM).
